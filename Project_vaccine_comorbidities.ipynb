    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "In hope of ending the global COVID-19 pandemic, multiple vaccines have been rapidly developed around the world. However, vaccine hesitancy due to safety concerns is hindering its usage. Phase II and III clinical trials showed promising results regarding both efficacy and adverse effects, also in people with underlying medical conditions [Choi, 2021]. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the effect of two different COVID-19 vaccines, namely Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca, on people in the UK with different underlying diseases will be evaluated, aiming to shed more light on their safety. For this, the community-based UK Biobank cohort will be applied to extract the first doses of the COVID-19 vaccinations, underlying medical conditions and adverse events categorised according to the ICD-10, as well as deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the analysis will be split uf in two sections:\n",
    "* Effect of the first COVID-19 vaccination dose on adverse events.\n",
    "* Effect of the first COVID-19 vaccination dose on mortality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both sections start more generally with the full study population, are then reduced to only people with underlying medical conditions and finally, to specific  ICD-10 categories of underlying diseases. "

Both could be explained by confounders such as age, as older people had higher priority in getting the vaccine. This could be corrected for example through regression analysis as done by Xiang et al. or by matching unvaccinated and vaccinated persons as done by Barda et al.\\\n",
    "The analysis has several strengths and limitations. One strength of this analysis is the limitation of the survival bias by prescription-time distribution matching by allocating a random date out of the issue dates of the vaccinated individuals to each unvaccinated individual. Further, we have found no preceding analysis of the effect of covid vaccination on people with specific underlying disease categories. Limitations include the calculation of a risk ratio instead of the time-related hazard ratio (as done by Xiang et al.) and the calculation of occurrences in general as opposed to the incidence, which would be the number of events within a given time frame. The confidence interval of the risk ratio would better be analysed with the percentile bootstrap method as described by Barda et al. \\\n",
    "Further next steps could be taken after optimizing the analysis method. First, the risk/hazard ratio of getting the vaccine could be compared to getting SARS-Cov-2 to put things in perspective. Second, the time of AEs and deaths could be analysed. Third, more specific underlying diseases that could be of relevance in this context such as myocarditis, thrombosis or lymphadenopathy could be analysed. Finally, a subgroup of fully vaccinated people as opposed to the here analysed group with at least one vaccine within the most recent dataset could be analysed."
